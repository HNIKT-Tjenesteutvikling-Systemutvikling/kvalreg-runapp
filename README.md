# RunApp

Welcome to RunApp, a blazingly fast application runner rewritten in Rust. Previously implemented using shell scripting, RunApp has undergone a significant transformation and now leverages the power and speed of Rust to provide a more efficient, reliable, and blazingly fast experience.

## Overview

RunApp is designed to automate and streamline the process of setting up, running, and managing your applications. With its new Rust-based architecture, it offers a blazingly fast and more efficient alternative to traditional shell scripting.

## Features

- **Blazingly Fast Execution**: Thanks to Rust's performance characteristics, RunApp executes tasks at a speed that was not possible with the previous shell scripting implementation.

- **Improved Error Handling**: Rust's robust error handling mechanisms allow RunApp to handle unexpected situations gracefully, providing clear and helpful error messages.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Rust's excellent cross-platform support ensures that RunApp works consistently across a wide range of operating systems. Only runs(blazingly fast) on NixOS

- **Efficient Resource Usage**: With Rust, RunApp uses system resources more efficiently, leading to a smoother and blazingly fast user experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with RunApp, you'll need to have Rust installed on your system. If you don't have Rust installed, you can download it from the official website.

Once you have Rust installed, you can clone this repository and build the project using Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HNIKT-Tjenesteutvikling-Systemutvikling/kvalreg-runapp.git
cd runapp
nix build
```

This will create a blazingly fast executable in the `result` directory. You can run this executable to start using RunApp.

## Conclusion

We're excited to bring you this new and improved version of RunApp. With its blazingly fast performance and robust error handling, we believe that RunApp will significantly improve your productivity and efficiency. Give it a try and experience the speed of Rust!
